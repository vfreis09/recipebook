recipe book project.
my objective with this project is learn node with postgres without using an orm.
it was based on this video: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFiqctkoVJ4&list=PLillGF-RfqbaEmlPcX5e_ejaK7Y5MydkW&index=2&ab_channel=TraversyMedia

Im putting more focus on the backend side of the videos, so im not using all the frontend stuff (dustjs and etc.)
feel free to change anything :)

frameworks that you need for this project:

express, 
pg, 
nodemon, 
node-postgres,
postman,
body-parser
